<h1> Different Types of Image Formats </h1>
<h2> PNG </h2>
<p> PNG is best for pictures with a transparent background as well as being able to compress
  a file without losing any quality. </p>
  <h2> JPEG </h2>
  <p> JPEG files are quite common as they are used for digital camera pictures, but may lose some quality
    when compressed. </p>
    <h2> GIF </h2>
    <p> GIF, similarly to PNG, uses lossless compression, and is also used to store animations without
      losing any quality.
