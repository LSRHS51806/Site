      Go In-- you go into the whole to find a family of dwarves living there, which probably explains the message on the
       cave wall and the small hole.  The dwarves seem pretty friendly and invite you to stay, but claim to not know how
       you got into the cave.  There is some mystery meat being served at the table, but you don't think twice about eating
       it due to your hunger.  Stay with the dwarves or leave out of fear? </p>
