      Leave-- they seem to be reluctant to let you leave because they don't seem to have visitors often.
      They reveal that they planned to cook you in a stew, but you seem cool enough to live with them.
      You decide to live with them in pursuit of a more prosperous, off-the-map life.  Congratulations,
      you have survived. </p>
